Live migration refers to the process of moving a running virtual machine or application between different physical machines without disconnecting the client or application. Memory, storage, and network connectivity of the virtual machine are transferred from the original guest machine to the destination.It is frequently utilized by the users who need to perform equipment upkeep on a physical host. One can simply live-migrate all VMs off the host, at that point live migrate them back once upkeep is finished. This is conceivable on the grounds that guest virtual machines are running in a virtualized situation rather than straightforwardly on the hardware. Performing a QEMU live migration requires a similar sort of CPU on the hosts, the same kernel version and shared storage among the migrating VMs. Shared storage guarantees that the host PCs can access the storage back end during a QEMU live migration. 

Objective:
Live migration alludes to the way toward moving a running virtual machine or application between various physical machines without disengaging the client or application. This project is aimed at performing live migration of a virtual machine between two physical hosts utilizing QEMU console
